#Vehicle Rental Management System Using C++

PROBLEM EXPLANATION

Vehicle Rental System is based on a concept to rent cars and bikes, generate rental invoice of a rental company. Before stepping into the main system, a user has to pass through a login system to get access, then only the user can select cars and bikes with a different model and rent for certain days. This mini project contains limited features, but the essential one.
Talking about the features of the Vehicle Rental System, after logging in as a user he/she has to provide a name then the user can select available cars and bikes. After selecting a car or bike, the system displays selected car or bike details which contain maximum power, mileage and many more. Then the user has to provide the information such as Car or bike number and number of days to rent the car. After all these procedures, the system calculates rent and displays Customer Invoice presenting invoice number, customer’s name, car model, number, number of days and total rental amount.

MAIN FEATURES:

1.main (): Here I create a menu using while loop and I will call create( ) and login() functions.
2.Login (): Here the user has to login and after that book desired vehicle.
3.create (): Here I create account using do while loop and data file handling concepts
4.book my vehicle (): Here I create account using do while loop and data file handling concepts.

This is a trendy project and very useful for learning about keyboard events, date-time functions, and implementing a C++ login system. The program has separate menus for admin and other users. There are also methods to calculate fare based on time and distance, including displaying car details, availability, etc.


Flow of code

1.	Creating an account with all required details.
2.	Storing all these details in the database that is text file named “createacc.txt” using file handling concepts.
3.	Log in screen asks you to enter registered user name and the password, once it matches with password in text file, Booking a vehicle screen is displayed.
4.	There is a choice to book either car or a bike of your choice. We have only 5 cars and bikes entered in this code.
5.	Once they choose any vehicle, cost of that vehicle along with other taxes ae displayed on the screen.
6.	User has to pay the amount displayed on the screen to get their desired vehicle for rent.
7.	This completes the overall functioning of our code.

This is a multiple user system as n users can register and login with the same text file.
